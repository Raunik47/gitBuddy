✨ Why GitBuddy?
Unlike basic code search tools, GitBuddy implements a production-ready Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that understands your code's context, architecture, and relationships. It's like having a senior developer available 24/7 to answer questions about your codebase.

Quick Start: Connect a GitHub repo → AI processes your code → Start asking questions → Get instant, accurate answers with code references.
